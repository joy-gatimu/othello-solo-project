Set out the Othello board and give each player 30 disks. Set the square 8 x 8 board in between the players. Decide who wants to play 
as black and who wants to play as white. Then, give each person 30 disks, which are black on one side and white on the other. 
Flip all of your disks so the color you chose is face-up.
